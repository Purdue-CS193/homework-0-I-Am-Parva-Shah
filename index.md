# Parva's First CS193 Homework

- My favorite thing about CS 19300 is learning how to use practical tools such as GitHub. I have tried to use GitHub before such as when I was in my high school robotics competition but found it difficult to figure out. I appreciate having a class to figure out how to use GitHub
- Additionally, I like how the subject ties in to other CS classes such as CS 18000 that I am currently taking. I find that some of my classes are not connected to each other so I like having classes that feel like they belong with each other.
- I also like the pacing of the class,  rather than being a long lecture with just note taking, I like how there are parts to ask questions or figure things out. I also like how there are examples given to show the concepts rather than just being told things.
